## Overview

GOLDS-UFSC is a space technology demonstration mission created by the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The main goal is to provide the service module for the Environmental Data Collector (EDC) payload from INPE-RN. The service module was developed at UFSC and it has three main components: the Electric Power System (EPS), the On-Board Data Handling (OBDH) and Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C).

Besides performing the EDC main functionalities, the mission will contribute to validating key technologies that will enable faster and cheaper development of future satellites reusing the same core structure. As an educational mission, it also serves to train engineering students in space mission conception, design, implementation and operation in all areas involved. 

It also acts as an experimenting platform for research in space technologies developed before, during, and after the operations phase of the mission, providing empirical data for experiments of many kinds. GOLDS-UFSC is expected to be launched by the end of 2020. Details of all systems developed for the mission are described in the documents listed in this repository in a top-level fashion and the detailed technical module documents in their respective repositories. This documentation structure is described in the <a href="#repository-organization">repository organization</a> section.

The SpaceLab OBDH2 (On-Board Data Handling 2.0) is one of the service modules developed for GOLDS-UFSC Cubesat Mission. The OBDH2 is responsible to synchronize actions and the data flow between other modules (ie. EPS, Payloads) and the Earth segment. It packs the generated data into data frames and transmit back to Earth through TTC module, or stores it on a non-volatile memory for later retrieval. Commands sent from Earth segment to the cubesat will be received by the radio transceivers located in the TTC module and redirected to the OBDH2, which takes the appropriate action or forward them to the responsible module. All the OBDH2 project, source and documentation files are available freely on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/obdh2) under its respective licenses.

The TTC (or TT&C) is the communication module of the CubeSats from SpaceLab. It is responsible to make the communication between the earth (a ground station) and a satellite, and is divided in two sub-modules: Beacon and telemetry. The beacon is a independent sub-module who transmits a periodic signal containing an identification data (ID) of the satellite and some basic telemetry data. The telemetry sub-module is the main communication device. It has a bidirectional data link to receive telecommands from the earth and transmit all the requested data. The telemetry sub-module is controlled by an external device (as example, an OBDH module). All the TTC project, source and documentation files are available freely on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/ttc) under its respective licenses.

</p>

<img align="right" width="25%" src="https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/golds-ufsc-doc/blob/master/figures/payload-x-pcb-top.png">

The Payload X was developed to perform an in-orbit validation (IOV) of two new technologies: a novel radiationhardened FPGA and an IP Core for telemetry and telecommand following the ECSS/CCSDS standard. The hardware was designed following the European Space Agency (ESA) space product standards. It has a layered structure that mitigates the effects of radiation and electromagnetic interference on the components signals. The implementation stored in the FPGA includes not only the TC/TM IP core, but also an abstract execution graph, in the form of a state machine, emulating the basic functionalities of an on-board computer (OBC). The communications module handles TC and TM data and it is an interface between the radio transceiver and the emulated OBC. The emulated OBC is based on the ECSS Telemetry & Telecommand Packet Utilization Standard (PUS), and it performs the validation of the routed telecommand received, and the packeting of the telemetry data acquired by the available sensors.

Our Attitude Control System (ACS) is a passive attitude system, which uses Earth's magnetic field to rotate and stabilize the satellite. The system is composed of one magnet to create a force to align the magnet with the Earth's magnetic field and four hysteresis bars to damp the cube oscillations and stabilize. They are placed in positions to minimize the magnet effect on the bars. As a passive magnetic attitude control system is used, it is possible to stabilize only two axis, and so, the cubesat will still rotate around one of its axis, even after stabilized.

The USIPED 2-Unit CubeSat structure is developed as a generic, modular satellite structure based upon the CubeSat standard. The modular chassis allows for up to two 1-Unit stack of PCBs, or other modules, to be mounted inside the chassis, using the PC-104 standard and spacers attached to the structure. In addition, there are 4 slots in the middle section, providing space for the interface boards and the ACS. The solar panels and antennas are externally mounted, providing a complete mechanical solution.

The ISISPACE CubeSat Antenna System 1U/3U contains up to four tape spring antennas of up to 55 cm length. The deployment system relies on a thermal knife composed of one wire and two redundant heating elements per tape. RF phasing / BalUn circuitry ties the antennas together in the user-defined configuration. Depending on the configuration, one or two radios in the CubeSat can connect to the antenna system by means of miniature RF connectors. The top face of the antenna system can accommodate a two solar cell solar panel and it can be customized for accommodating sensors or other systems to protrude to the exterior, e.g. camera apertures. The antenna is compatible with any UHF and/or VHF radio system. It can be mounted on all ISIS CubeSat structures and Pumpkin rev C and rev D CubeSat structures. For custom made structures, which adhere to the CubeSat standard mechanical envelope, mounting should also be possible.

The SpaceLab FlatSat Platform is a testbed for cubesat pcb modules. FlatSats enable easier, faster and secure method for testing subsystens indenpently or integrated in a flat design before going to assembly on a cubesat standard. The PCB can support up to 7 modules, all PC104 pins are interligated with each respective counterpart to flexibilize its use, only the particularity connection between modules need to be be taken into account. All the PC104-ADPT project, source and documentation files are available freely on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/flatsat-platform) under its respective licenses.
